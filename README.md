                             Assembly Language Program 1
=============================================================================
File Format: COM
Authors: Hanna Miko≈Çajczyk, Natalia Nykiel

Description:
This program calculates the expression: 3*a+b/c, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are
taken from predefined arrays. It sorts the array elements in ascending order
and then performs the calculation on each element of the array.

Program Structure:
- Defines data segment for declaring variables and arrays.
- Initializes the data including an array, its length, and flag variables.
- Defines code segment for program execution.
- Implements sorting algorithm to sort the array elements.
- Calculates the expression for each element of the sorted array.
- Ends the program execution.

Usage:
This program is meant to be assembled and run in an MS-DOS environment using
an assembler like Turbo Assembler (TASM) and a linker like TLINK.

Instructions for Compilation and Execution:
1. Assemble the program using TASM;
2. Link the object file using TLINK;
3. Run the generated executable file;

This assembly language program, named "arch.asm", is designed to run in a 16-bit
DOS environment. It prompts the user to input two numbers within the range of
[-32768...32767], validates the input, performs arithmetic operations on the
input numbers, and displays the result.

Program Structure:
- The program consists of several sections, including the main code segment
  labeled "Kod".
- It begins with a prompt to the user to input two numbers.
- The program then enters a loop to handle the input process for each number.
- Input validation is performed to ensure that the input is within the allowed
  range and is a valid number.
- After both numbers are entered, the program performs arithmetic operations,
  including addition and negation if necessary.
- Error messages are displayed for invalid input.
- The result is then printed to the console.

Usage:
1. Assemble the program using an assembler compatible with 16-bit DOS programs,
   such as TASM (Turbo Assembler).
2. Link the object file generated by the assembler.
3. Run the generated executable file in a DOS environment.

Note:
- This program assumes a DOS environment and may not run correctly on modern
  operating systems without a DOS emulator.
- Care must be taken to ensure that the input numbers fall within the specified
  range, as the program does not handle out-of-range inputs gracefully.

Assembly Instructions:
- The assembly code is written using Intel syntax and is meant to be assembled
  with an assembler compatible with Intel 8086 architecture.
- The code is heavily commented to explain the purpose and functionality of
  each section and instruction.
