=============================================================================

Program Name: arch.asm
File Format: COM
Authors: Hanna Miko≈Çajczyk, Natalia Nykiel

Description:
This program calculates the expression: 3*a+b/c, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are
taken from predefined arrays. It sorts the array elements in ascending order
and then performs the calculation on each element of the array.

Program Structure:
- Defines data segment for declaring variables and arrays.
- Initializes the data including an array, its length, and flag variables.
- Defines code segment for program execution.
- Implements sorting algorithm to sort the array elements.
- Calculates the expression for each element of the sorted array.
- Ends the program execution.

Usage:
This program is meant to be assembled and run in an MS-DOS environment using
an assembler like Turbo Assembler (TASM) and a linker like TLINK.

Instructions for Compilation and Execution:
1. Assemble the program using TASM;
2. Link the object file using TLINK;
3. Run the generated executable file;
